# Potassium

Potassium is a level editor for Super Monkey Ball 1 and 2. It may possibly support Deluxe some time in the future.

Right now it is *very broken*. Don't try to use it for anything.

## Contributors

You might want to wait until this project is a little more stable before jumping in. If you're still interested in working on it, send me an email at [github@trashbyte.io](mailto:github@trashbyte.io). Since the project is so disorganized right now, I need to make sure anyone working on in knows where I'm headed. Don't just make a pull request, I'm going to ignore it unless you've talked to me first.
